    "text": "Front Matter\nThe content in this “book”, as the title suggests, is related to advanced statistical modeling and reproducibility. More specifically, the content focuses on expanding the General Linear Model (GLM) to provide statistical evidence that can help answer substantive questions in the educational and social sciences. It also includes computing content for leveling-up educational scientists’ reproducibility of analyses.\nWhile it is a book intended for applied practitioners in the educational or social sciences, and the statistical content is hopefully presented in a manner that these domain scientists will find useful, it does require a good foundation in regression analysis using the GLM. Moreover, since the content is somewhat mathematical in nature, the reader will need a solid understanding of algebra for maximum benefit. The burden of calculation that typically accompanied statistical work in previous generations is now primarily carried out in a scientific computing environment. As Thisted & Velleman (1992) point out, “computational advances have changed the face of statistical practice by transforming what we do and by challenging how we think about scientific problems.” To support and help facilitate the use of scientific computing, examples using the R computer language will be used throughout this work.\nThe organization of content is consistent with the sequence this content is taught in EPsy 8252, the second of two applied statistics courses that form the foundational sequence for many graduate students in the educational and social sciences at the University of Minnesota. This course require that students have taken a previous statistics course at the graduate level focusing on the GLM.",

Although there are many computational tools for statistical analysis, the first tools we will add to your computational toolkit is R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It can be installed on a variety of operating systems, including the MacOS, Windows, and UNIX platforms. To really make use of the computational power of R, we are also going to introduce you to RStudio, an open-source front-end1 to R.\nThe initial chapters of this document will address:",
